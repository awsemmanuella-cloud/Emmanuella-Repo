#  My First GitHub Repository  

Hi there, I’m **Emmanuella** 
This is my very first repository on GitHub, and I’m using it as the starting point of my **Cloud & DevOps journey**.  

---

##  About This Repo  
Just like a LinkedIn bio tells you about a person, this repo tells you about my project journey:  
- It’s my sandbox for learning Git, Docker, and AWS.  
- It’s where I test, break, and rebuild while growing my skills.  
- It’s the first step in documenting my learning path publicly.  

---

##  What You’ll Find Here  
- `hello.txt` → my first Git-tracked file   
- Future practice projects (Docker, AWS configs, automation scripts)  
- Notes & documentation to track my progress  

---

##  Why This Repo Exists  
Every professional journey starts somewhere.  
For me, this repo = **Day 1 of building real projects with GitHub**.
